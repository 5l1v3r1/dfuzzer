.SH NAME
dfuzzer \- Tool for fuzz testing processes communicating through D-Bus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dfuzzer
.B \-n
\fIBUS_NAME\fR
[\fIOTHER_OPTIONS\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdfuzzer\fR is D-Bus fuzzer, a tool for fuzz testing processes communicating
through D-Bus. The fuzzer traverses through all the methods on the given bus name.
By default only failures are printed. Use -v for verbose mode.
By default the session bus is used. Use -s to use the system bus.

Fuzz tests are being done on methods of a chosen interface(s) and an object(s)
for the given bus name. dfuzzer generates random arguments for each method
of an interface and calls these methods everytime with different generated arguments.

dfuzzer is monitoring tested process state and memory usage during fuzz testing.
In case tested process crashes or its memory usage is abnormal it is stated
on the output of dfuzzer.


.SH REQUIRED OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-n\fR \fIBUS_NAME\fR
.RS 4
D-Bus name to test.
.RE


.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Print dfuzzer version and exit.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Print dfuzzer help and exit.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Enable verbose messages.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Enable debug messages.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
Use system bus instead of the default session bus.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR \fIOBJECT_PATH\fR
.RS 4
Optional object path to test. All children objects are traversed.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR
.RS 4
Interface to test. Requires also -o option.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR \fIMEM_LIMIT\fR [in kB]
.RS 4
When tested process exceeds this limit it will be noted into log file.
Default value for this limit is 3x process intial memory size. If set memory
limit value is less than or equal to process initial memory size, it will be
adjusted to the default value (3x process intial memory size).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR \fImax_buf_size\fR [in B]
.RS 4
Maximum buffer size for generated strings, minimum is 256 B.
Default maximum size is 50000 B ~= 50 kB (the greater the limit, the longer
testing).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR \fIMETHOD_NAME\fR
.RS 4
When this parameter is provided, only method \fIMETHOD_NAME\fR is tested.
All other methods of an interface are skipped.
DO NOT USE IN AUTOMATIC SCRIPTS, AS IT NEEDS TO BE USUALLY TERMINATED BY SIGINT!
